# Testing Notes

## Windows
- Does everything work on Windows 7 and 8?
- Does the app work correctly on a 32 bit system? (should I even build a 32-bit exe?)

## Mac
- Does dark mode switching work while open?

## Linux

## *NIX
- Simitone needs to be run as root the first time is that error being handled?

## All

- What features are available as an elevated user?
- Does the maximize bug exist on other platforms?
- What does the launcher look like without network access?
